IMPORTANT

- Provide recurse command line switches (especially -R and perhaps -,
	allowing for find . -name '*.rb' -print | rtags -)

LATER 

- Recognise 'alias :name' tokens
- Find modules with double colon notation like "BIO::MODULE::IO"
- Cache class names so classes can be found that lack an initialize
	method
