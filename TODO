IMPORTANT

- Provide - command line switch, allowing for 
	  find . -name '*.rb' -print | rtags -

LATER 

- Recognise 'alias :name' tokens
- Find modules with double colon notation like "BIO::MODULE::IO"
- Cache class names so classes can be found that lack an initialize
	method

MUSINGS

I am thinking of making vim the default target. I have the impression           
it is the favoured editor these days.                                           
                                                                                
Apart from adding the - switch at some point in the future it would
be neat to have smarter tags. For one, if a class has not initialize
method we would like to jump to the class definition on
Classname.new. If we were to store the tags we find in memory
(instead of just writing them out, as is the current behaviour) it
would be trivial to implement.  

Also some tokens (alias) and multilines are not handled correctly.
Try:                                                                            
                                                                                
cd ./test                                                                       
ruby ../bin/rtags -R                                                            
                                                                                
and you get                                                                     
                                                                                
Warn: parse error in <./data/report.rb> in line 170, pos 4                      
                                                                                
which is an unrecognised alias.
