This is the original commit of the rtags source code as written by Keiju
ISHITSUKA as part of the irb project. Now irb has moved into the main Ruby
source tree rtags has become an independent project.

At this point you can just run rtags in lieu of ctags, provided irb is
installed on your system. It works alright!

We aim to provide a better installation routine and a unit test frame work
before improving the code base.

rtags is distributed under a RUBY LICENSE and is hosted at rubyforge:
